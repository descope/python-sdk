"""
Sample script demonstrating outbound application management with Descope Python SDK.

This script shows how to:
1. Create outbound applications (OAuth/OIDC providers)
2. Manage application settings  
3. Handle user tokens for outbound applications

Outbound applications allow Descope to connect to external OAuth/OIDC providers
like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. as a client.
